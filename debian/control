Description: library to handle creation and inspection of ISO-9660 file systems
 libisoburn is a frontend for the libraries libburn and libisofs. It handles
 the creation, loading, manipulation and burning of ISO-9660 filesystem images.
 This library provides a low-level API, called libisoburn API, which
 enhances and partly encapsulates the API of libburn and libisofs. Further
 there is a higher level API, called xorriso API, which completely encapsulates
 the API of libburn, libisofs, and libisoburn. It implements all parts of
 xorriso except the small initialization module xorriso/xorriso_main.c .
 .
 This package contains the shared object files for libisoburn.

Description: command line ISO-9660 and Rock Ridge manipulation tool
 xorriso is a command line and dialog application, which creates, loads,
 manipulates, and writes ISO-9660 file system images with Rock Ridge
 extensions.
 .
 It maps file objects from POSIX compliant file systems into Rock Ridge
 enhanced ISO-9660 file systems and features session-wise manipulation
 of such file systems. It can load the management information of existing
 ISO images and write the resulting session to optical medium or as
 file system objects.
 .
 Supported optical media types:
  - CD-R, CD-RW
  - DVD-R, DVD-R DL, DVD-RW, DVD+R, DVD+R DL, DVD+RW, DVD-RAM
  - BD-R, BD-RE
 .
 Some interesting features:
  - Emulation of the mkisofs and cdrecord programs.
  - Data backup and restore capabilities - compression, ACLs, and filters.
  - Isohybrid MBR with partition offset - features booting ISOLINUX from
    USB sticks, or from other devices that appear to PC-BIOS as hard disks.
    The images carry a conventional partition table for a USB stick;
    the first partition reports the size of the ISO image, but starts at a
    non-zero address. It is nevertheless still mountable.
  - Jigdo Template Export - jigdo representation of the resulting ISO-9660
    image, generated on the fly.
 .
 Test suite:
  xorriso source code comes with a release engineering test-suite called
  `releng', which aims to cover most of the functionality of the xorriso
  and the underlying libraries of libburn, libisofs, and libisoburn.

Description: educational GUI frontend for ISO-9660 manipulation tool xorriso
 xorriso is a command line and dialog application, which creates, loads,
 manipulates, and writes ISO-9660 file system images with Rock Ridge
 extensions.
 .
 xorriso-tcltk offers the most important features in a single GUI window
 together with help texts and references to xorriso's man page.
 The xorriso commands which get triggered by GUI components are shown in a
 scrollable text field or optionally may get logged to a file.
 Click on any GUI component by the rightmost mouse button to see the
 component's help text.

Package: xorriso-dd-target

Description: Device evaluator and disk image copier for GNU/Linux
 xorriso-dd-target is a command-line tool to evaluate block devices
 of the Linux kernel whether they are suitable targets for a disk image
 file and to optionally copy the image file to one of them.
 It is specialized on the device names of the Linux kernel and uses the
 capabilities of util-linux program lsblk. Therefore it refuses to run
 on non-Linux kernels.
 .
 The main purpose of xorriso-dd-target is to inspect the device files of
 disk-like storage  media and to judge whether they look like removable
 devices with disposable content.
 If a single plausible candidate is detected, then the program is
 willing to copy a disk image file onto it. This will overwrite or make
 inaccessible the previous partition table and all previous data content
 of the target device.
